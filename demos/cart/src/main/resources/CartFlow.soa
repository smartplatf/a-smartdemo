# This is part of the SMART demo for Plug and Play Demo.
#
# This file describes the jar file that is 
# deployed. The name is the handle via which all
# events to this flow are referenced. In this case,
# all services exposed will be of the format
#
# http://server:port/tenant/CartFlow/....
#
# This Flow has two data, 3 events, 1 transition and two
# responses all bucketed into the all feature. The CartItem
# data uses the standard configuration and hence the key is
# just configured into this file.
#
# The links specifies the link between the two data objects 
# and is used to establish a link table. This creates a table
# called __PPDemo-CartFlow__CartItem__Cart which stores
# the relations between Cart and CartItem.
#
# The needslink is the most important of this example. This
# indicates to SMART that this flow has to be mashed up with
# another flow when enabling. Since this does not have an
# optional flag, this link has to be provided when enabled
# and cannot be enabled without it.
#
# Further it says that the link is established via the AddToCart
# event's cartItem. This link has to be specified if an
# event has to be posted to an object of another flow.
#
# When this flow is enabled, the following is provided to link
# the object:
# 'links':[
#   {
#     'name':'itemlink', 
#     'flow':'CatalogueFlow', 
#     'object':'Catalogue',
#     'attribute':'skuId'
#   }
# ]
#
# The first link establishes the itemlink which is the name of
# the link here.
#
# Mashing up in this manner creates the table called
# __PPDemo-CartFlow__CartItem__Catalogue
# which stores the relation between CartItem and Catalogue.
