# This is part of the SMART demo for Plug and Play Demo.
#
# This file describes the transition java class
# CartManager. Any transitions present in the
# flow, needs to have this description file. This 
# indicates to SMART what methods have to be called for
# what events and data. 
#
# In this case, we have two transitions for the AddToCart, RemoveFromCart
# and GetCartItems events. The below indicates that the addToCart can be
# called for the Cart data when it is in both the empty and added status. 
# From any of these states, the Cart will transition to the added status.
#
# The removeFromCart is against the CartItem when it is in active state, which
# means that it is a valid cart item. It transitions to an inactive which is the
# end state and hence is not in the cart anymore.
#
# The getCartItems is called to retrieve the cart items for a cart and can be
# called only if the Cart is in the added status. If it is empty there are no 
# items to be retrived and hence cannot be called.
