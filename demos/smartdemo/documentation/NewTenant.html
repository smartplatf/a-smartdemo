<h6>Summary</h6>
<blockquote>SmartOwner is the default tenant created in every SMART platform and is used to administer SMART. The NewTenant event is used to create a new tenant in SMART. This sets up an isolated runtime environment for the tenant. By default the tenant comes with the standard flows - Security, AllFlows, AdminSmartFlow and Monitor. When a tenant is created, a custom flow can be enabled for the tenant. If not, the EnableFlow event can be called to enable a flow. The first flow enabled cannot be mashed up with anything and has to be an independent flow.</blockquote>
