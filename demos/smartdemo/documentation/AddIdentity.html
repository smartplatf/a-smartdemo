<h6>Summary</h6>
<blockquote>SMART provides out of the box security that allows users to be associated to roles and access granted based on roles. SMART hence provides a user functionality that allows to create a single user and associate multiple identities to the same user. The user can login using any of the identities. The AddIdentity event creates an identity for the user. Unless an identity is added no permissions can be used.</blockquote>
