<h6>Summary</h6>
<blockquote>SMART provides out of the box security that allows users to be associated to roles and access granted based on roles. SMART hence provides a user functionality that allows to create a single user and associate multiple identities to the same user. The user can login using any of the identities. The CreateUser event creates a new user in SMART for the given tenant. Call the AddIdentity event to create an identity for the user. Unless an identity is added no permissions can be used.</blockquote>
