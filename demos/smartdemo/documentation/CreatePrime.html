<h6>Summary</h6>
<blockquote>SMART provides a set of events that can be used by all flows. These events are typically raised on the flow admin and provides helper services. The CreatePrime is one such service that creates Prime Data of any flow. This calls the standard transitions that are written for the event. Customizations can be added to this by providing a transition for the FlowAdmin and CreatePrime combination with the name of the object to be created.</blockquote>
