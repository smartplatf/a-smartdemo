 * SUMMARY
 * ************************************************************
 * This is part of the SMART demo for Basic Demo.
 *
 * This class contains the functions that has to be executed when
 * and event occurs. This is called transitions. In our case, we
 * do not need to do anything other than change the state of the
 * object. Hence we do not have any function defined here, but
 * just an empty class.
 *
 * Refer to transitions documentation for more details.
